A model of Earth electric grid, from France to Japan, from nuclear plant to solar panel farms, from average power per site up to pressure in a pipe.

## motivation

>

    How to compare French production to Italy production?

    How to compute the montlhy average renewable energy of Europe against USA?

    What about EDF performance against RWE?

    Any idea about the impact of quitting nuclear energy in Germany?

    What hardware is used on prem here and there?

To answer these question we need to represent our international grid on a common structure. I found none, so here is "parc", an open source python library to store/structure and deliver public information about ALL electricity production systems.

## Sources

In order to keep this project open source all the information available in this library should always be public. Contributors should quote their public sources in the codebase when sharing information.
